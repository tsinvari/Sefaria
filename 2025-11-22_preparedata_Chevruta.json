Each maror is named after one of the seven levels of hell in #jewish mystical thought. Will I survive?? Will I be able to answer any of the questions? Or is this my personal Gehennom??

Welcome to “A Woman in An Act of Desperate Creativity: Chana’s Prayer Deep Dive with Ammud Rabbinic Intern Sass Brown.” In this chevruta session, Sass and I learn from the story of the prophet Chana as told in the Tanach, and the Talmud, to discover how Jewish prayer was shaped and defined by a woman. We also find some modern takeaways from Chana’s bold actions. \n\nAbout Ammud: Ammud exists to empower Jews of Color by providing community and personalized support to gather and learn, unchallenged in their Jewishness. They provide access to the Jewish education needed to be empowered members and leaders of the broader Jewish community, creating space to celebrate marginalized customs and traditions and (re)build culture.\n\nSefaria sourcesheet: www.sefaria.org/sheets/616541\n#jewishlearning #tanach #torah",
